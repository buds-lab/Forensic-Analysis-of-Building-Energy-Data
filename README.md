Background  
----------

If you are unfamiliar with IPython Notebook you can start with http://ipython.org/notebook


Installation  
------------

* Prerequisites  
One of the following distributions is needed. Please note that even if you have Python installed it is important to have one of these distributions installed and the binary for this installation in your path. This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.

  * Enthought Canopy from https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/
  * Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io


* The following steps assume you have installed one of the distributions mentioned in prerequisites.

* From a zip or tar file
    * download the zip or tar file 
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
    * navigate to the folder containing the downloaded notebooks and start the desired file
